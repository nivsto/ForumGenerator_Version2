Torrential rain has hit the area for most of the week and began again during Manchester City's Asia Trophy final with Sunderland on Saturday at the same venue.

In a statement, United described it as joint decision between the club, Hong Kong FA, Kitchee FC and said: "The pitch has suffered from torrential rainfall in the last week and has staged a number of games in a very short space of time. Wednesday's matches - Sunderland vs Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester City vs South China - had their kick-offs delayed, only proceeding after being shortened to 40-minute halves. The weather has continued to present problems for the pitch and the first consideration of both the HKFA and Manchester United has to be the safety of the players in such conditions.
